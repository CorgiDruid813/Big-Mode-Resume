        Hard working and tenacity are the core elements I believe on. I love the world of politics and keep up to date on current events to understand what is going on around us. I get my information from media outlets that are neutral, in which have no bias. My goal one day is to become mayor of La Verne, California becauase that is the city I grew up in and love. I understand that there will be challenges along the way, nonetheless that is one of the reasons I fell in love with this field. I am always looking for challenges to overcome, efficeintly and effectively. When I encounter that I have made a mistake I practice reflecting on how that incident ocurred and make sure that accident never happens again. The inspiration that I have to join the field of politics or public policy is that I want to observe and communicate with the members of this community and understand what problems they have. In addition, raise policies that address these issues to fix them and make sure that the community understands that their local government is on their side. <br><br>

        Outside my line of work, I have a few hobbies to keep myself busy. One particular activity I like to do is playing video games. I enjoy a vast amount of video game genres from strategy games, first-person shooters and to games that involve adventure. Video games help my mind become stimulated, develop problem-solving techniques and critical analysis of situations that need to be successfully completed. These games include: Sid Meir's Civilization 6, League of Legends, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Other great PC games that I truely love are: Overwatch, Call of Duty Cold War, Among Us, Borderlands 2, Halo: The Master Chief Series (Halo Reach and Halo ODST are amazing too). Playing on Virtual Reality is also a sureal experience, in which I can interact with objects from the video game as if I was in physical form of the game. Great virtual reality games that I love playing are: Gorn, Beat Saber, Superhot, Blade & Sorcerry and Pavlov VR Another past-time activity I enjoy doing is collecting vinyl records. Collecting vinyl records from the 1980's through the 1950's are always amazing becuase the sound quality and feeling of placing the needle on the record is fantastic. Lastly, the last activity I enjoy doing is cooking. Cooking allows me to try new recipes and enjoy the deliciousness of what I have created. If I find that I made the recipe wrong and that the food does not taste as great, I simply would make sure that I take note of it in my cooking journal to make sure that error does not happen again.
